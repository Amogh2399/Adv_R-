üéµ **Introduction**

This document provides a brief exploratory analysis of a Spotify listening history dataset. The dataset includes information about individual tracks played, artists, albums, the platform used, and timestamps.

# üîç Dataset Summary

The dataset contains **Spotify track play records** collected over time. Key variables include:

-   `artist_name`: Name of the artist.
-   `ms_played`: Duration (in milliseconds) of each play.
-   `ts`: Timestamp when the track was played.

# üé∂ Most Played Artists

Below is a bar chart showing the **top 10 most played artists**, based on total listening time (in hours).

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load dataset
spotify <- read.csv("spotify_history.csv")

# Process data to compute top 10 most played artists by time in hours
top_artists <- spotify %>%
  group_by(artist_name) %>%
  summarise(total_hours = sum(ms_played, na.rm = TRUE) / (1000 * 60 * 60)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_hours)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)

# Plot
ggplot(top_artists, aes(x = reorder(artist_name, total_hours), y = total_hours)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "brown") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Most Played Artists",
       x = "Artist",
       y = "Total Listening Time (hours)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Following are the Observations:**

-   The bar chart highlights listening preferences over time.

-   The Beatles appears prominently in the dataset , suggesting high user engagement.

-   Data includes both fully played and partially skipped songs.
